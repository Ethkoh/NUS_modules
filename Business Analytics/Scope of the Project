Scope of the Project:


Describe a business case problem that involves decision-making under uncertainty. The case could
be hypothetical but it should look realistic. Your description should be clear about the following:
• What is the business problem in the case?
• What are the decisions that have to be made and decision criteria?
• Where are the sources of uncertainty? (That is, which are the random variables? For the
problem to be non-trivial such that a simulation analysis is necessary, there should be at
least two (2) random variables, which are not both normally distributed.)
• What are your recommendations based on your analysis of the problem?
Use EXCEL to perform a simulation analysis of the problem. The following must be included:
• EXCEL simulation model (MUST be able to perform sensitivity analysis on the worksheet)
• Analysis of results from EXCEL simulation
• Presentation of results using a histogram or boxplot
